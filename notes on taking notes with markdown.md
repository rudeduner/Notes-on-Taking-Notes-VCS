# **Taking Notes on Taking Notes with MD on VSC**

## *Learn how to use markdown extension*
    - End new file with '.md' to indicate it's a markdown file
    - Use # to indicate headers. ex. # H1, ## H2, etc.
    - Surround text with ** to make bold, use * for italics
    - Use cmd+shift+v to make preview in new window (or hit icon of tile with magnifying glass)


### *Learn basic terminal commands*
    - Downloaded iterm2. Believe I changed shell to bash.
  
-[A link to basic terminal tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRYQsKR46I)

 **Commands** 

    1. open finder window to find out whats going on
    
    2. pwd -print working directory.
   
    3. ls -list. enter ls, prints out all directories
   
    4. cd - change directories. if you hit 'cd ..' the '..' lets you know what parent directory you're in. if you run 'cd.' this means current directory.
    
    5. clear or 'cmd +k'- movesd all previous code up and leaves you with a blank canvas.
    
    6. to move to a previous command line hit the up arrow. to descend to a latter command line hit down arrow
    
    7. history - will itemize all previous commands
   
    8. rm - remove. ex, 'rn test_file.txt' will delete the file. /// can I do this wil word docs, pdfs, etc?
   
    9. mkdir - make directory (aka a folder) 'mkdir test_directory' will create a directory in whatever directory you're in. 
   
   - While in the directory (check with pwd) you can make a file inside of it 'touch test_file'.  
   
   - You can also make a file inside a directory without being in the directory. 'touch test_directory/second_test' 
   
    10. 'rm r-' will delete directory. 'rm r- test_directory'  A word of caution, rm will not send files to trash, it just deletes. **I could not get this to work, but get the concept.
   
 
*nano editor*
* make a test text file 'touch test_file.txt'
* open file 'open test_file.txt'
* to edit remotely run 'nano test_file.txt'
* nano will allow you editing abilities. after done hit control + o to save, 'control + t' to files, and hit 'y' to overwrite. follow prompts. to check work simply open file 'open test_file.txt'
